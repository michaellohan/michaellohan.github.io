                    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part I: Understanding and Writing HTML
                    </h2>

The first thing you need to learn when making a web site is basic HTML. The Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. Using resources such as w3schools you will learn all the basic tags that are required when putting together a web page.

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part II: Styling and CSS
</h2>

Once you've got basic HTML down, it's time to learn styling and CSS so you can make your HTML look the way you want it. This lesson covers the basics of working with Cascading Style Sheets. You will use the Bootstrap CSS framework to layout your web page, add images, content and navigation.

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part III: A Site from Start to Finish
</h2>

Now that you've got basic HTML and CSS down, you will learn the process of creating a site from start to finish. This will include how to link all the files and folders involved in the web project and make them work together.

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part iV: Choosing a Host and Launching Your Site</h2>


Now that you know how to make a site, you need to get it online so everyone can see it. This lesson will include how web servers work, which ones to use and how to access them. 

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part V: Additional Resources
</h2>

Before you go, you will be given a list of resources to use to further your study, pointed in the right direction and given a brief intro to Javascript and the jQuery library.

                    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part I: Introduction to MIT's App Inventor
                    </h2>

App Inventor is a great tool for teaching code and allows the learner to see quick results. The introduction will cover how to access App Inventor, create a project and the difference between the blocks and designer editors. 

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part II: The Designer
</h2>

Once you have your project started and are aware of the different editors, it is time to begin adding components. This will cover the different layouts that can be used and how each component can contribute to the project.

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part III: The Blocks 
</h2>

For each component you added in the designer you will need to specify how you want them to work. This is done primarily in the blcoks editor. This lesson will go through the different types of blocks and how they can be used to supply functionality for your components. 

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part iV: The emulator</h2>


Now that you have some components and functionality you will want to test to see if it works correctly. This is achieved by running the app in an emulator. You will discover the different types of ways you can do this.

<h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part V: Additional Resources
</h2>

Before we let you go, we will give you some additional resources to help you keep learning and make your apps great.

                        </h2>

    Alice is an animation tool used primarily to teach individuals how to code. This lesson will include how to download and install Alice. Then create a project and becoming familiar with the two different interfaces that we will be dealing with. 

    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part II: The Designer
    </h2>

    Similar to App Inventor's designer this screen lets you add components to the project, in this case the components are thought of as objects. 

    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part III: The Blocks
    </h2>

    Just the same as App inventor it is now time to give the objects you added some functionality. The code that the learner will be exposed to in this section will be Java code. Java code is one of the leading languages in the world and can be used to accomplish almost anything in the programming world.

    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part iV: Loops, If's and Variables </h2>


    To make each object interact with each other for a lengthy period of time loops can be used. You will be exposed to the different types of loops and learn when to use each type. If statements are also a great way to increase flexibilities of characters in the animation and when used with variables can be extremly powerful. 

    <h2 class="intro-text text-left">Part V: Playing you animation and Additional Resources
    </h2>
    Learn how to play your animation and package it so it can be uploaded to youtube or played on another device.
    Before we let you go, we will give you some additional resources to help you keep learning and make some great animation.
